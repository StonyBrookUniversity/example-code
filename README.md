============

This GitHub repo contains code that I have authored for various reasons. The current list of work is as follows:


<dl>
  <dt>CMSC412 Project 5: GOSFS - GeekOS File System (http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2011/cmsc412/project5/index.html)</dt>
  <dd>The code is located in <strong><em>/cmsc412-project5/</em></strong>.</dd>
  <dd>The purpose of this project was to implement a UNIX-like filesystem in the class OS (GeekOS). It included up to double-indirect blocks to facilitate large file sizes. I wrote the code in /src/geekos/gosfs.c and /include/geekos/gosfs.h.</dd>
  <dt>CMSC421 Project 5: Pacman Capture the Flag (http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2011/cmsc421/projects/contest/contest.html)</dt>
  <dd>The code is located in <strong><em>/cmsc421-ai-contest/</em></strong>.</dd>
  <dd>This project challenged me to write an AI, using knowledge gained from the class, to compete in a contest with other students in a Pacman-like game. My AI agent (PrincessCelestia) took first place in the final rankings (http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2011/cmsc421/projects/contest/results/final.html). The implementation is in /myTeam.py.</dd>
