============

This GitHub repo contains code that I have authored for various reasons. The current list of work is as follows:

<dl>
  <dt>CMSC412 Project 5: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2011/cmsc412/project5/index.html">GOSFS - GeekOS File System</a></dt>
  <dd>The code is located in <a href="https://github.com/ericnorris/example-code/tree/master/cmsc412-project5">/cmsc412-project5/</a>.</dd>
  <dd>The purpose of this project was to implement a UNIX-like filesystem in the class OS (GeekOS). It included up to double-indirect blocks to facilitate large file sizes. I wrote the code in <a href="https://github.com/ericnorris/example-code/blob/master/cmsc412-project5/src/geekos/gosfs.c">/src/geekos/gosfs.c</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericnorris/example-code/blob/master/cmsc412-project5/include/geekos/gosfs.h">/include/geekos/gosfs.h</a>.</dd>
  <dt>CMSC421 Project 5: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2011/cmsc421/projects/contest/contest.html">Pacman Capture the Flag</a></dt>
  <dd>The code is located in <a href="https://github.com/ericnorris/example-code/tree/master/cmsc421-ai-contest">/cmsc421-ai-contest/</a>.</dd>
  <dd>This project challenged me to write an AI, using knowledge gained from the class, to compete in a contest with other students in a Pacman-like game. My AI agent (PrincessCelestia) took first place in the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2011/cmsc421/projects/contest/results/final.html">final rankings</a>. The implementation is in <a href="https://github.com/ericnorris/example-code/blob/master/cmsc421-ai-contest/myTeam.py">/myTeam.py</a>.</dd>
  <dt>CMSC330 Project 4: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2010/cmsc330/p4/">Scheme Parser & Interpreter</a></dt>
  <dd>The code is located in <a href="https://github.com/ericnorris/example-code/tree/master/cmsc330-project4">/cmsc330-project4/</a>.</dd>
  <dd>I had to write a (subset of) Scheme interpreter in OCaml, a functional programming language, for this project. It was an interesting challenge to write in a functional style as opposed to a more imperative style. The interpreter is in <a href="https://github.com/ericnorris/example-code/blob/master/cmsc330-project4/scheme.ml">/cmsc330-project4/scheme.ml</a>.</dd>
